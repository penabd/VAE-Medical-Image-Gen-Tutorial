# Conditional Variational Autoencoders for Medical Image Generation

This repository contains code and experiments for training a **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** on chest X-ray images from the **CheXpert** dataset. The project focuses on learning structured latent representations and generating anatomically plausible medical images conditioned on auxiliary information.

The codebase is designed to run primarily in **Google Colab**. It leverages Google Drive for persistent storage and Colab’s GPU resources for training.

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **Google Colab** 
- **Google Drive** account with access to the CheXpert dataset
- GPU runtime enabled in Colab
